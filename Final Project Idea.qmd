I would like to look at what effects views in all countries. I feel the most important stat in a YouTube video is the views because of AD revenue and more views equals more subscriptions. I would like to see how the channel, likes and dislikes effect the videos views (data from 2019 when dislikes were still active). I will do this for multiple countries to see if this is universal or country based.
